## HERO SECTION

### Headline
# Ship While You Live Your Life

### Subhead
Your AI executive team — CTO, CPO, CMO — thinking, debating, and executing while you're at your day job.

Built by a founder who ships between bus routes.

### CTA Button

## PROBLEM SECTION

### Heading
## You know what to do. The problem is doing it.

### Body
You've taken the courses. Read the books. Watched the founders on YouTube telling you how they made it.

You understand the frameworks. You know the strategy.

But you're still stuck — because **execution is the bottleneck.**

Not ideas. Not drive. Not knowledge.

Just... too much to do, and only one of you.

### Pull Quote
> "I was being taught what to do, but I still had to do everything myself."

## SOLUTION SECTION

### Heading
## What if you had a leadership team?

### Body
Control Tower gives you three AI executives, each with a real specialty:

**Ada — CTO**  
Architecture, systems, technical tradeoffs. The one who tells you when something won't scale.

**Grace — CPO**  
Priorities, scope, what to build next. The one who cuts the feature creep.

**Tony — CMO**  
Story, positioning, what makes people care. The one who turns your product into a movement.

They live in your Discord. They debate your decisions. They produce while you're living your life.

### Pull Quote
> "I can direct, and agents can execute."

## PROOF SECTION

### Heading
## Built between bus routes

### Body
Control Tower wasn't built in a garage with VC money.

It was built by a founder with a day job — someone who spent years learning Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure while the rest of the world slept.

The same founder who took the courses, followed the frameworks, and still couldn't get traction. Not because of lack of knowledge. Because execution was too heavy.

Then something clicked.

AI didn't just make things faster. It moved him up a level — from laborer to architect.

48 hours later: a working AI executive team, coordinating strategy, shipping output, while he drove his bus route.

### Pull Quote
> "For the first time, I don't feel alone building something."

## UNLOCK SECTION

### Heading
## The same abstraction that changed everything

### Body
Stripe removed payment friction.  
Cloud removed server friction.  
GitHub removed collaboration friction.

**Control Tower removes execution friction.**

For the first time, you can operate as the architect — the one who directs — not the one who does everything.

### Pull Quote
> "This removes execution friction."

## FINAL CTA SECTION

### Heading
## Ready to stop doing everything yourself?

### Body
We're opening Control Tower to 50 founders first.

Small group. Hands-on support. You help shape the product, we help you finally ship.

### CTA Button
`Get Early Access →`

### Subtext
*Solo founders only. No VCs, no agencies, no tire-kickers.*

## VISUAL NOTES

**Hero image concept:**  
Discord screenshot showing #strategy channel with Ada, Grace, and Tony mid-conversation. Real debate visible. Caption: "Yesterday's board meeting."

**Proof section image concept:**  
Subtle, minimal. Maybe a quote card or the founder story pull quote on a dark background.

**Overall vibe:**  
Dark mode. Clean. Technical but human. No stock photos. No corporate polish.

## META / SEO

## NOTES FOR CARRD BUILD

- Keep sections short and scannable
- Use pull quotes as visual breaks
- Dark background, light text
- Single column layout
